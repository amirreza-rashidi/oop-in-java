# 2nd OOP Project - Void Method



This is a simple Java project that demonstrates how `void` methods work inside classes and why arrays (or collections) are useful when dealing with multiple objects.



## ðŸ§  Purpose



When we define a `void` method (like `printInfo()`), it performs an action such as printing something, but \*\*does not return any value\*\*.  

In this project, we use a `void` method to print student information for multiple objects.
