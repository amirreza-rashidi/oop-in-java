# 3nd OOP Project - Return Method

This Java project demonstrates how return-type methods work in object-oriented programming (OOP) and highlights the importance of using arrays or collections when managing multiple objects of a class.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

Instead of printing directly from within the class, this project uses a method that **returns** a formatted string with object data (e.g., name and age). This gives you more control and flexibility over the output, especially when working with multiple objects.
