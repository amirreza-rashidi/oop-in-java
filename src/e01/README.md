# First OOP Project - Objects Without Arrays

This is a simple Java project to demonstrate why arrays (or collections) are important when creating multiple objects from the same class.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

When we create multiple instances (objects) of a class, we quickly realize that without arrays or lists, we can't:
- Loop through them easily
- Access or manage them dynamically
- Store or retrieve them efficiently

This project shows what happens when we create several objects manually and try to work with them without using any array or list.
